## What is FINESST?

**Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST)** is a NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) program supporting graduate student research projects in:
- Earth Science  
- Planetary Science  
- Astrophysics  
- Heliophysics  
- Biological & Physical Sciences (in some calls)

FINESST **funds up to three years** of graduate research at up to **\$50,000 per year**. Proposals must be relevant to **NASA’s strategic goals**, use NASA data (especially for Earth Science), and adhere to NASA’s open-science and data-sharing policies.

## Proposal Components

Per the **FINESST** or **ROSES** instructions, you typically need:

1. **Proposal Summary (on NSPIRES cover page)** – Anonymized.  
2. **Science/Technical/Management (STM) Section (6 pages)** – **Anonymized**.  
   - Background, research questions, proposed methods, contingency plans, NASA relevance, timeline.  
3. **References & Acknowledgements** – No page limit, but must also be **anonymized**.  
4. **Open Science and Data Management Plan (OSDMP) (2 pages)** – **Anonymized**.  
5. **Mentoring Plan or Agreement (2 pages)** – **Anonymized**.  
6. **Research Readiness Statement (1 page)** – **Not anonymized**.  
7. **Biosketches (PI and FI; NASA forms)** – **Not anonymized**.  
8. **Current and Pending Support (PI and FI)** – **Not anonymized**.  
9. **Budget and Narrative** – Typically 2 pages. **Not anonymized**.

**Dual Anonymous Peer Review** means your main science document must avoid identifying info (no personal names, institutions, or specialized references that reveal your identity).

### Anonymized vs. Non-Anonymized
- **Anonymized**: STM section, references (numerical style), and certain supporting docs.  
- **Non-Anonymized**: Research Readiness Statement, Biosketches, Budget docs, etc.

Refer to NASA’s **ROSES** or the **FINESST solicitation** for exact page limits and requirements (they may change year-to-year).

## Dual Anonymous Peer Review (DAPR)

NASA’s **DAPR** guidelines require that **reviewers do not see personal or institutional identifiers** in the main science proposal. Basic principles:
- Do **not** say “my previous work” or identify your lab’s unique data.  
- Use a neutral, third-person approach to reference prior publications.  
- Omit specific collaborators’ names or small-group campaigns if they reveal your identity.  
- Number your citations (e.g., [1], [2]) instead of using standard author-year citations.

## Application & Submission Process

1. **Set Up NSPIRES**  
   - Register at [https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/index.do](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/index.do).  
   - Your advisor (PI) must be registered; you are designated the Future Investigator (FI).

2. **Prepare Required Documents**  
   - **Anonymized**: STM (6 pages), OSDMP (2 pages), Mentoring Plan (2 pages), references.  
   - **Non-Anonymized**: Research Readiness (1 page), Biosketches, Budget, etc.

3. **Coordinate with Your Institution**  
   - **Office of Sponsored Projects** or **Grants Office** may have an internal deadline (often days/weeks before NASA’s).  
   - They typically do the final submission.

4. **Upload & Finalize**  
   - Combine all required sections (some anonymized, some not) according to NASA’s instructions.  
   - PI “Releases to Organization,” then the AOR (Authorized Organizational Representative) officially submits.

5. **Await Notification**  
   - NASA typically announces selections a few months later.  
   - Reviews and feedback come via NSPIRES to the PI.

## Review Criteria & Selection

NASA typically evaluates FINESST proposals on four main criteria:

1. **Scientific/Technical Merit**  
2. **Relevance to NASA**  
3. **Research Readiness** (FI’s background, timeline feasibility, synergy with the PI’s expertise)  
4. **Cost Reasonableness** (budget clarity, adherence to the \$50K/year limit)

Expect an **adjectival rating** (e.g., Excellent, Very Good, etc.) plus reviewer comments.

## FAQ & Common Questions
1. **Can non-US citizens apply?**  
   - Yes, if they are enrolled at a U.S. institution. Check official FINESST guidelines for details.

2. **Is NASA data required?**  
   - **Earth Science**: Must show a clear link to NASA data (e.g., satellite data, airborne campaigns).  
   - **Other divisions** may have different constraints, but Earth proposals generally need NASA datasets.

3. **What if my research is partially funded elsewhere?**  
   - FINESST allows you to show other grants in Current & Pending but ensure your proposed tasks are distinct or complementary.

4. **What if I can only justify 2 years?**  
   - You can request 1–3 years. NASA often funds multi-year proposals, but it’s okay to request fewer if that’s sufficient.

5. **What is the typical selection rate?**  
   - Usually around 15% across divisions (varies each cycle).
